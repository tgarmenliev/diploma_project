This information can be found at the beginning or at the end of the wagon. (picture below) At the beginning or at the end of each wagon (depending on the direction in which the train is moving) there is a separate place where the initial station, the final station and the number of the wagon are written. The number of the wagon is of utmost importance when you want to find your place in the train, but more on this topic can be seen in another article, specially dedicated to this topic.\nWhen you find this important field of the wagon, you can directly understand if this is really your train.",
